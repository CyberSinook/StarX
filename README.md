## 🐧 Overview

StarX GNU/Linux is an Arch-based operating system engineered around a simple idea:

A system should be powerful, understandable, and coherent.

StarX focuses on delivering a refined and transparent environment where users maintain full control without unnecessary complexity or artificial abstraction.

This is not a themed remix of Arch.  
This is a structured operating system vision.
